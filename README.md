FAQ:

2. How does this works? - Game will think, that you have added your own mod to it.
3. This changes will be visible only for YOU! Arcana effects, aracana model, visual effect will be visible only for you! Everyone else will see, that you use base model and base effects. 
4. Current mod will replace your default towers, default terrain, default hero equipment.

6. How to delete the mod? - Go to "dota 2 beta\game\dota" and delete gameinfo.gi file. After that go to steam, right click on the Dota 2 - Properties - Local files -  Click button "Verify integrity of game files ..." . 
OR
Edit "gameinfo.gi" file. Put // before dota2ti10 strings, so it will looks like this:
//Game                dota2ti10
//Mod                 dota2ti10
